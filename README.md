Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Connor Broxton and this is my submission for the Logisitics UK technical test.

The styling is pretty basic to save on time but have tried to include some examples of modern css practices. I've also enabled sass but ended up not using any aside from in `global.scss` ðŸ˜† as was experimenting with using [TailWind](https://tailwindcss.com/). I found it very useful but think there's probably still some areas that would be better written using custom css selectors.

I have a lot more experience using Angular, this was my first time using React in quite a while and so I was picking up React and Next.js as I went so apologies if anything is a bit off, conventions etc.

To run...
